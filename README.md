The command "git add ." adds all the files in the current directory to a staging area. The command "git commit -m "your message here"" makes any changes in the staging area final, and helps with version controll because the commit message shows the reason why any changes were made. The command "git push -u origin main" moves files to another place where they can be saved and submitted.
